## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### Deploy Frontend:
```bash
# 1. Set your backend URL
export REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL="https://your-backend-url.com"

# 2. Run deployment script
chmod +x deploy-frontend.sh
./deploy-frontend.sh
```

### Deploy Backend:
```bash
# Already deployed! Backend is ready on AWS Lambda
# Just verify it's working:
curl https://your-backend-url.com/health
```

---

## ðŸ§ª CRITICAL TESTS BEFORE GO-LIVE

### Test 1: Basic Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-backend-url.com/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### Test 2: Campaign Creation
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.com/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Campaign",
    "script_template": "Hello, this is a test call.",
    "max_concurrent_calls": 5
  }'
```

### Test 3: Frontend Connection
1. Open frontend in browser
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify "LIVE" status shows (not "DEMO MODE")
4. Test campaign creation from UI
5. Test call initiation flow

### Test 4: End-to-End Call Flow
1. Create a campaign
2. Upload a test lead
3. Initiate a call
4. Verify call appears in AWS Connect
5. Test transfer functionality

---

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Frontend Shows "DEMO MODE"
- Check `REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL` is set correctly
- Verify backend health endpoint is accessible
- Check browser console for API errors

### "Failed to connect to backend" Error
- Verify backend URL is correct
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Verify backend is deployed and running

### Calls Not Initiating
- Check AWS Connect configuration
- Verify phone numbers are configured
- Check CloudWatch logs for errors

### Dashboard Not Loading Data
- Check API service configuration
- Verify backend analytics endpoints are working
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

---

## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT CONTACTS

### Technical Issues:
- Backend API: Check CloudWatch logs
- Frontend: Check browser console
- AWS Connect: Check AWS Connect console

### Configuration Issues:
- Environment variables: Check `.env` files
- API keys: Verify in AWS Systems Manager
- Database: Check RDS connection

---

## ðŸŽ‰ GO-LIVE APPROVAL

Before going live, ensure:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Backend health check returns 200
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Campaign creation works
