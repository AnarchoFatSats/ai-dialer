        Hi [Name], this is [Agent] from SolarMax Solutions.
        
        I'm calling homeowners in [Area] about the new solar incentives that just became available.
        
        Have you noticed your electric bill going up lately? Many homeowners are seeing 20-30% increases.
        
        We've been helping homeowners like you eliminate their electric bills entirely and even earn money back from the utility company.
        
        Can you tell me roughly what you're paying for electricity each month?
        
        Based on what you're spending, you could potentially save $150-250 per month with solar.
        
        The best part is, there are programs where you can go solar with zero money down.
        
        Would you like me to have one of our energy consultants give you a free assessment to see exactly how much you could save?
